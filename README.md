<b>Personas:</b>
Marina Valmy is the owner of a beauty school and also has her own product line. She currently has a software application that manages all the daily tasks in the school but does not have any functionality to manage product sales and inventory. Marina is looking to implement a new POS system that will help her keep track of product sales and inventory. This system will also help in the actual sales as it works integrated with the cash register.

<b>Problem Scenarios:</b>
Marina wants to streamline the product sales and the inventory in order to have a more organized system and to know when a product is needed.

<b>Current Alternatives:</b>
If Marina wants to know how many products she has in stock she tells the receptionist to count manually the number of products available. When a customer wants to buy products this sale is done manually there is a need for a calculator and a written receipt. 

<b>Value Proposition:</b>
By implementing a new Point of Sale (POS) system the receptionist will spend less time in the process of selling the product and will be able to improve customer service. It will allow more time to spend in creating a better relationship with the customer and the place will look more organized.
Creating a digitized index, cataloging the location, album, song and artist, Byron could better locate and enjoy a specific music selection making better use of his limited timeframes.
